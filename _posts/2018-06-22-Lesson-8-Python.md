    <td>Looking at my partners and seeing how the do their work right would help me get further on, but not copying them. Another strategy is to be quiet so that Mr Ampah-Korsa did not have to stop the lesson to tell that person of for being loud, would help us all learn. I also tried going slowly so that I got all the information.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Listening to my partners would've helped, so then they could help me with code. Also what I need to work on is going faster on the exercise but also understanding the code in it as well. Also what I need to work on is to stop going onto github to add containers when I can do it at IT club or my spare time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I would have liked to get on turther into python but instead I only did a few parts. I will try to be faster next time. Next time I will try not to talk to my partners and not go onto github without Mr Ampah-Korsas permission. Next time I will try to get further on in the exercise. Next time I will improve on my speed in Python but I will still try to obtain all the information.</td>
