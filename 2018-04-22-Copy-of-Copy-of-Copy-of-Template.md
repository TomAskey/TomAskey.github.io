    <td>Not listening to the teacher would've helped, so then I could hear him say "Delete repositories only, not your complete blog" Also what limited my learning is that we had to do a seat plan at the start which made us start later.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I have to restart my blog I will delete the repositories instead of deleting my account details and the blog itself so I donâ€™t have to set it up again. Also I would have liked to get on turther into python but instead I only did a few parts.</td>
